          <p class="quote">Web development is the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a
            private network).[1] Web development can range from
            developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications (web apps),
            electronic businesses, and social network services.</p>
            <p>
            A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering,web
            design, web content development, client liaison,
            client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.Among
            web professionals, "web development" usually
            refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use
            content management systems (CMS) to make content
            changes easier and available with basic technical skills. For larger organizations and businesses, web development
            teams can consist of hundreds of people (web developers)
            and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing websites. Smaller organizations may only
            require a single permanent or contracting developer, or
            secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web
            development may be a collaborative effort between departments
            rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of web developer specialization:
            front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.
            Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end
            developers deal with the servers.</p>

          <h2>This is another Article</h2>
          <p class="quote">Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing industry. The growth of this industry
            is being driven by businesses wishing to use their
            website to advertise and sell products and services to customers.[3]There are many open source tools for web
            development such as BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux,
            Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning web development to a minimum. Another
            contributing factor to the growth of the industry
            has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and
            Microsoft Visual Studio. </p>
            <p> 
            Knowledge of HyperText Markup
            Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned
            and implemented quickly.An ever-growing set of tools
            and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers now
            help to deliver applications as web services which were
            traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to
            decentralize information and media distribution.
            Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Drive. These
            web services allow users to interact with applications from many locations, instead of being tied to a specific
            workstation for their application environment.</p>
